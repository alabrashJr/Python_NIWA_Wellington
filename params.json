It is a completely free enterprise-ready Python distribution for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing. It includes the python interpreter itself, the python standard library as well as a set of packages exposing data structures and methods for data manipulation and scientific computing and visualization. In particular it provides [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [statmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/), i.e. all the main packages we will be using during the tutorial. The full list of packages is available at:\r\n\r\n[http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html)\r\n\r\nThe Anaconda python distribution must be downloaded from:\r\n\r\n[http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads)\r\n\r\nFor your platform.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed Anaconda, you can update to the latest compatible versions of all the pre-installed packages by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ conda update conda\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ conda update anaconda\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a terminal.\r\n\r\nYou also need to install [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) to install packages from the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ conda install pip\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation of additional libraries\r\n\r\nWhile we might not have the time to cover them in depth during the tutorial, I would recommend that you have a look at a few extra libraries.\r\n\r\n### Basemap\r\n\r\n**Basemap** is a graphic library for plotting (static, publication quality) geographical maps (see [http://matplotlib.org/basemap/](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)). **Basemap** is available directly in **Anaconda** using the conda package manager, install with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ conda install basemap\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bokeh\r\n\r\n[Bokeh]() is a new interactive plotting library developed by the team behind **anaconda**: it is thus installable with conda (if not already installed):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ conda install bokeh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Seaborn\r\n\r\n[seaborn](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. You should be able to install it with ```pip```:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install seaborn\r\n```\r\nor (if you want the bleeding edge version):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install git+git://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn.git#egg=seaborn\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may have to install 2 additional libraries for seaborn, `husl` and `moss`. If you experience failures during `seaborn` installation or when trying to import it, try:  \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install husl\r\n$ pip install moss\r\n```\r\n\r\n### mplD3\r\n\r\n[mplD3](http://mpld3.github.io/) aims at *bringing matplotlib to the browser*. It has been developed by Jake VanDerPlas. It is also installable by ```pip```:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install mpld3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### bearcart\r\n\r\n[bearcart](https://github.com/wrobstory/bearcart) has been developed by [Rob Story](http://wrobstory.github.io/) and provides an interface to the rickshaw JavaScript library. It is also installable via ```pip```:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install bearcart\r\n```\r\n\r\n### folium\r\n\r\n[folium](https://github.com/wrobstory/folium)  has been also been developed by [Rob Story](http://wrobstory.github.io/) to provide an interface to the [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) JavaScript mapping library. Install with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install folium\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr size=5>\r\n\r\n## Running the IPython notebooks\r\n\r\nThe material of the tutorial is in the form of [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). In a nutshell an IPython notebook is a web-based (i.e. running in the browser) interactive computational environment where you can combine Python code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document, which makes it an ideal medium for teaching and exploring.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter uncompressing the archive of the repo (or after cloning it with ```git```), navigate to the corresponding directory (containing the ```*.ipynb``` files) and type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ipython notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should bring up the IPython notebook dashboard, you should be ready to go !\r\n\r\nYou should see in particular a ```test.ipynb``` notebook: please run it to make sure all the necessary libraries have been installed correctly. If you followed the instructions above (install the [anaconda python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads)) it should be fine, this test notebook is mostly intended for those who have a *custom* python installation.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
